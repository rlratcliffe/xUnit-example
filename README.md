# Quotes

"If we make a mistake implementing this, then we won't be able to see the mistake because the exceptions won't be reported."

"When I pick the next test to implement, I find a test that will teach me something and which I have confidence I can make work. If I get that test working but get stuck on the next one, then I consider backing up two steps."
